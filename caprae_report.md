# Caprae AI Readiness Challenge – Lead Scorer Tool

## 🎯 Objective
Build a smarter lead generation tool in 5 hours that improves on SaaSquatchLeads by focusing on **lead quality**, not just scraping volume.

## 🛠 Features Implemented
- CSV input for company names
- For each company:
  - Validates email (via regex or API)
  - Checks LinkedIn and website presence
  - Scores leads based on data reliability
- Clean UI built using Streamlit
- Exportable scored leads table (CSV)

## 🤖 Scoring Formula
Score = (Email valid × 0.5) + (LinkedIn found × 0.3) + (Website alive × 0.2)

## 💼 Business Value

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
